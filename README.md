#This is a website that I've made to test my skills by recreating the work of a master.

##Original Link- https://www.dylanbrouwer.design/work

##Demo Link- https://dylan-brouwer-clone.netlify.app/

The website I have created has a lot of flaws, like it is not fully responsive and functional as it has only single page. Also it is not all screen responsive it can only run on desktop. and a lot.
but I've tried to create the replica, and I'll make it fully functional in the upcoming days!

#Things I've used
- React.js
- Framer Motion
- Swiperjs

#Wanna Run in your Local Machine
- clone the repo to your personal computer
- run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies
- run `npm run dev` to run the program locally
  Note- make sure to have node js install in your PC.
